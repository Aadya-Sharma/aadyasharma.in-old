New Delhi: The paucity of safe spaces and gender-neutral policies for queer students in most educational institutions is a result of the heteronormativity ingrained in our society's ideals, making the world dangerous for LGBTQ people; our society's heteronormative attitude is hurtful and destructive.

The message that being attracted to others of the same or similar gender is inappropriate is sent when this idea is accepted as the norm. Additionally, it conveys the false idea that such people don't exist.

This is homophobic and is immensely problematic since it is emotionally destructive to people of all sexual and romantic identities, besides heterosexuality. Heteronormativity is the belief that heterosexuality is the only normal and natural expression of sexuality.

Creating a safe space for LGBTQ+ individuals is essential and is of utmost importance. Colleges and schools should be safe and welcoming environments for everyone. All classrooms include LGBTQ students, although many aren't yet comfortable being open about their sexualities or gender identities.

Recruiting teachers who are queer affirmative teachers and staff and introducing policies that integrate LGBTQ topics into the curriculum is the first step toward a safer and more inclusive environment.

Schools and universities should establish gender-neutral and sensitive policies and also encourage the students and faculty members to wear badges with their pronouns to avoid misgendering anyone.

This step will not only make the college or school more diverse, but it will also aid in teaching the students and make their interactions more healthy and diverse.

In all honesty, I believe everyone has a right to feel comfortable and express themselves freely in their schools and colleges.

The installation of gender-neutral restrooms, and changing rooms and the introduction of gender-neutral uniforms is another crucial measure that schools and colleges ought to implement because it would benefit students who identify as gender non-conforming, non-binary, gender fluid, or transgender.
