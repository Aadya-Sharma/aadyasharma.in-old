The need for safe spaces for people who are part of the LGBTQ+ community remains ever-present, especially in educational institutions.

***

Before I started college, I recall wanting to establish an LGBTQ+ inclusive club to provide a haven for queer individuals, but the paradigm of heteronormativity tragically dashed my ambitions.

When I first had the idea to start a queer club, I reached out to one of my seniors who helped me connect with another senior who shared the same vision as I did. However, I was unaware that they had already created a proposal for an LGBTQ+ club and given it to the Dean of Student Affairs (DSA), who is in charge of such things. However, the DSA initially ignored their proposal for days before finally rejecting it a month later, claiming that "parents wouldn't approve of this."

The world is unsafe for LGBTQ people because heteronormativity has long been ingrained in our society's beliefs; this attitude is harsh and damaging. The message that being attracted to others of the same or similar genders is inappropriate is being sent when this idea is accepted as the norm. Additionally, it conveys the completely false idea that such people don't exist. This is homophobic, and it is extremely problematic because it emotionally harms people of all sexual orientations and romantic identities.

The creation of a safe space for LGBTQ+ people is crucial. There are LGBTQÂ students in all classrooms at colleges and universities, however many are still hesitant to be open about their sexual orientation or gender identity due. E employing educators that are LGBTQ+ affirming and enacting rules that incorporate LGBTQ+ topics into the curriculum is the first step to creating a safe and welcoming atmosphere. This will not only make the college or school more diverse, but it will also aid in teaching the students and teachers. It will also make the relationship between students and teachers healthier and more diverse.
